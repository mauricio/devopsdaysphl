            <h1>Yeah, who cares, right?</h1>

		<section>
            <h1>The OPS team cared</h1>
			<p>When there was a new build to publish they would be like...</p>

		<section>
            <h1>OPS people don't like change!</h1>
			<p>Shouts the angry developer mad that his code takes too long to reach production</p>			
        </section>

      	<section data-background="images/perfect-code.gif">
		  <h1>My code is perfect!</h1>

		<section>
            <h1>Boss: hey, we don't have OPS bandwidth to deploy your new app</h1>

		<section>
            <h1>Why?</h1>
			<p>I never felt the pain of pushing stuff</p>			
        </section>

		<section>
            <h1>Again, why?</h1>
			<p>I was never on call</p>			
        </section>

		<section>
			<h1>A safe place</h1>
			<p>Hiding developers of the pain of maintenance removes their ability to empathize</p>			
        </section>

		<section>
            <h1>Baptism by OPS fire</h1>
			<p>I had to learn it to keep the project moving, not doing it was not an option. </p>			
        </section>

		<section>
			<h1>How did it work?</h1>			
        </section>

		<section data-background="images/teamwork.gif">
			<h1>Teamwork!</h1>
        </section>

		<section>
			<h1>Developers need guidance</h1>
			<p>You might be able to get someone up to speed alone but that will take time. 
				Grooming new team members requires work.
			</p>
        </section>

		<section>
			<h1>Wear seatbelts!</h1>
			<p>
				Mistakes will be made but you don't want them to affect actual work. 
				You need sane testing environments and automated test suites.
			</p>
        </section>

		<section>
			<h1>Get on call</h1>
			<p>
				Also known as <strong>causing pain</strong>. Unfortunately, pain is still one of the 
				best sources of education and action. 
			</p>
        </section>

		<section>
			<h1>Having many perspectives</h1>
			<p>
				There are many competing interests working at the same project and company,
				work needs to be done to accomodate these interests.
			</p>
        </section>

		<section>
			<h1>Cross team, cross functional, cross whatever</h1>
			<p>
				No one is alone and moving people around produces better understanding
				of all the different needs inside a business.
			</p>
        </section>

		<section>
			<h1>Tearing down the wall</h1>
			<p>
				After the fist application was pushed, there was no more separation of 
				the <strong>me developer</strong> and <strong>me ops</strong>, when making a decision I had to consider the
				effects it would have when it was running.
			</p>
        </section>

		<section>
			<h1>And read Google's SRE book</h1>
			<p>
				Even if you're not doing OPS right now, it will
				change how you write software.
